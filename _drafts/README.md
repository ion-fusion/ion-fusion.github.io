Drafts are posts without a date in the filename. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t 
want to publish yet.

To preview your site with drafts, run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. 
Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you 
will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
