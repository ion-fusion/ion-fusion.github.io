title: First Contact

excerpt: We'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can improve our public content.

Ion Fusion grew up coupled to Amazon's internal developer toolchain for building, 
testing, deploying, documenting, and dependency management.
Today, we have our hands full trying to replace all that, and pretty much
everything around here is Work In Progress.

Among all of it, we prioritize improvements to our visitors' _first-contact experience_.
We want to help you understand what Fusion is, how to use it, and how to
contribute to its successðŸ¤ž.

Clearly, that experience is not ideal today: our [home page]({{ site.url }}) is nearly
barren, and our [documentation tree][docs] is downright ugly.
(It's a little embarrassing, honestly.)
But as fans of "bias for action" and "incremental delivery" and other buzzphrases 
advocating tight feedback loops, we wanted to get the essentials in place and
start iterating.
I tell my teams to work in "baby steps", so here we are. 

Since feedback loops work best with _customer_ feedback, we'd love to hear about 
_your_ first contact with our public content.  What was your first impression?
What worked well for you?  What was confusing? What was missing?
What should we focus on next?

Whatever you're thinking, get in touch:

* Our GitHub [Discussion forum][discuss] is the best place to post general feedback and questions,
  where the community can interact (and where search engines will pay attention).
* Bug reports and feature requests should go into [GitHub issues][new-issue] so maintainers can
  prioritize and track the work.
* We hang out in [Slack][] and [Discord][], which is great for casual conversation
  with the community, real-time chat between contributors, and the occasional video huddle.

Thank you for taking the time to help us improve.

Keep moving forward!
