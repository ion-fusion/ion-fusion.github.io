Greetings!  Whether you're a long-time Fusioneer or a curious guest, we're excited that you're
visiting the freshly-minted Ion Fusion website. <!--X-->
Though this is more of a Soft Launch than a Grand Opening:
like that funky new club downtown, we're comically underprepared for your arrival.

Since Ion Fusion `eval`ed its first `lambda` in [2012][first], it attracted a healthy and
helpful community inside Amazon, including software developers, data analysts, and 
programming-language enthusiasts from all over the world[^good].
It's fair to say that the community's love for this niche project supplied the 
energy to keep going despite a lack of resources[^bad].
Just as energizing is when, every few months, someone's goodbye-to-Amazon message ended with
_"Let me know when Fusion is open-sourced."_

[first]: https://github.com/ion-fusion/fusion-java/commit/0b5baa36255aaeee13699a076a506ee42d47a98d
[^good]: Working for a giant company can be incredibly cool.
[^bad]:  Working for a giant company can be incredibly depressing.


If you're a current or former Amazonian, welcome!
In case you haven't noticed, we go by "Ion Fusion" now[^mix].
Please join us as we share the love with a wider audience. Say hi on [Slack][] or [Discord][], 
let's catch up.

[^mix]: At least in mixed company.

If you're new to Fusion[^fam], welcome!
Please take a look around and [let us know what you think][feedback].
Fresh eyes can provide great feedback.

[^fam]: You're family now, you can call us that.

Either way, we hope you're intrigued enough to [join our community][comms] while we work toward a more-grand opening.


Share and Enjoy!
