# CODEOWNERS achieves two things:
#   * Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a
#     pull request that modifies code that they own.
#   * Repository Rulesets require at least one owner's approval before merging.

# Documentation for this file:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.


# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, these users will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
