We are experimenting with a variety of communication channels:

* **General feedback and chat** is welcomed in both[^both] [Slack][] and [Discord][]. We tend to 
use Slack for real-time chat between contributors, and Discord for casual
  conversation and the occasional video huddle, but feel free to use either.
* **Technical questions** should be directed to [GitHub Discussions][discuss], where the 
information can be discovered through web searches. Let's help make the next person's Google search a
  little easier!
* **Bug reports and feature requests** should go into [GitHub issues][new-issue] so we can
  prioritize and track the work.
* **Announcements** will be posted to our [News][] page here, and to Discussions, Slack, 
and Discord. (Unfortunately, only the chat services support push notifications.)

All of the above is subject to change as we see where people gravitate.

[^both]: Each app has unpleasant tradeoffs, and we hope the community's experience will show what works best. Feedback is welcome!
